Welcome! The concept for this blog is simple: I'd like an outlet to share some thoughts on my interests, both professional and casual. The posts will generally cover topics across software development, music, and running.

**But why have a blog anyway?**

![test 2](/images/test2.png)

I want a place to share my thoughts outside of social media. I purposely distanced myself from Instagram in 2020, and I'm hoping to cover meaningful ideas here. *Though, I'm still on Instagram to discover new music and enjoy the memes.*

I'd also like to shape the process behind my passions. By writing how I think, I'm hoping to refine my methods while working, running, or playing music.

Lastly, I'd like to continue to flex my design and dev muscles. I don't always get to be a developer at work, and I've built & designed this site (almost) entirely from scratch. Working on it allows me to continue using tech I like, such as:

- React (GatsbyJS)
- Styled Components
- Linters / Continuous Integration
- Design libraries
- And so on...

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned!
